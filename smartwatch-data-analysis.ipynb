Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare. So if you want to learn how to analyze smartwatch fitness data, this notebook is for you. In this notebook, I will take you through the task of Smartwatch Data Analysis using Python.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","\n","- This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5cc888ae","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002289,"end_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:13.811829","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:13.80954","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Import libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"fead0c75","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-11T15:42:13.819391Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-11T15:42:13.81887Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.139081Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.137276Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.328048,"end_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.142385","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:13.814337","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import plotly.express as px\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2b2a3382","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002298,"end_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.147448","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.14515","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Read Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"69bd948f","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.154858Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.154287Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.178539Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.176769Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.031969,"end_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.181874","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.149905","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"4aba2ac9","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.190757Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.189226Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.212293Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.210436Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.032477,"end_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.217243","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.184766","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["           Id ActivityDate  TotalSteps  TotalDistance  TrackerDistance  \\\n","0  1503960366    4/12/2016       13162           8.50             8.50   \n","1  1503960366    4/13/2016       10735           6.97             6.97   \n","2  1503960366    4/14/2016       10460           6.74             6.74   \n","3  1503960366    4/15/2016        9762           6.28             6.28   \n","4  1503960366    4/16/2016       12669           8.16             8.16   \n","\n","   LoggedActivitiesDistance  VeryActiveDistance  ModeratelyActiveDistance  \\\n","0                       0.0                1.88                      0.55   \n","1                       0.0                1.57                      0.69   \n","2                       0.0                2.44                      0.40   \n","3                       0.0                2.14                      1.26   \n","4                       0.0                2.71                      0.41   \n","\n","   LightActiveDistance  SedentaryActiveDistance  VeryActiveMinutes  \\\n","0                 6.06                      0.0                 25   \n","1                 4.71                      0.0                 21   \n","2                 3.91                      0.0                 30   \n","3                 2.83                      0.0                 29   \n","4                 5.04                      0.0                 36   \n","\n","   FairlyActiveMinutes  LightlyActiveMinutes  SedentaryMinutes  Calories  \n","0                   13                   328               728      1985  \n","1                   19                   217               776      1797  \n","2                   11                   181              1218      1776  \n","3                   34                   209               726      1745  \n","4                   10                   221               773      1863  \n"]}],"source":["print(data.head())"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":14.605839,"end_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:16.443269","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-04-11T15:42:01.83743","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
