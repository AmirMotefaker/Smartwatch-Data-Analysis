Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare. So if you want to learn how to analyze smartwatch fitness data, this notebook is for you. In this notebook, I will take you through the task of Smartwatch Data Analysis using Python.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","\n","- This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b0ab592a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00279,"end_time":"2023-04-11T15:47:19.496863","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-11T15:47:19.494073","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["#
