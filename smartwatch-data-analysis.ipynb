Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare. So if you want to learn how to analyze smartwatch fitness data, this notebook is for you. In this notebook, I will take you through the task of Smartwatch Data Analysis using Python.\n\n## Dataset\n\n- This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T16:53:48.171187Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T16:53:48.17193Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.7258Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T16:53:48.171876Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.724772Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.72779Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.728217Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.760179Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.728179Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.758762Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.761997Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.762494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.78643Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.762453Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.784803Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# null Values\n\n- Does the dataset contain null values or not?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.isnull().sum())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.789635Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.790189Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.800533Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.790127Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.798857Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- So the dataset does not have any null values. \n\n- Let’s have a look at the information about columns in the dataset:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.info())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.802689Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.803465Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.83676Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.803409Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T16:53:51.835127Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- The column containing the date of the record is an object.
